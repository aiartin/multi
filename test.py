CRS occurred in 75% of patients,\n2% of whom had Grade 2 3 CRS. The median time to onset was 2 days (range: 1 to 5\ndays) and the median time to resolution was 3 days (range: 1 to 14 days). The most\ncommon symptoms were fever (97%), tachycardia (52%), hypotension (30%),\n\n)\n', 'nausea/vomiting (21%) and headache (15%) [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Management\nfor CRS (including Grade 1) was tocilizumab (55%). Thirteen patients received one\ndose and five patients received more than one dose. Of the five patients who received\nmore than one dose of tocilizumab, two patients received dexamethasone in addition to\ntocilizumab.\n\nEnsure that healthcare providers administering TECELRA have immediate access to\nmedications and resuscitative equipment to manage CRS. Ensure patients are\neuvolemic prior to initiating the infusions.\n\nDuring and following TECELRA administration, closely monitor patients for signs and\nsymptoms of CRS. Following treatment with TECELRA, monitor patients for at least 7\ndays at the healthcare facility for CRS. Continue to monitor patients for CRS for at least\n4 weeks following treatment with TECELRA. Counsel patients to seek medical attention\nshould signs or symptoms of CRS occur. At the first sign of CRS, immediately evaluate\npatient for hospitalization and institute treatment with supportive care based on severity\nand consider further management per current practice guidelines.\n\n5.2 Immune Effector Cell-associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome\n\nImmune Effector Cell-associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) has been observed\nfollowing administration of TECELRA. One patient (2%) had Grade 1 ICANS. Time to\nonset was two days and time to resolution was one day. Symptoms included mild\nmental status changes. Other symptoms may include disorientation to time and place,\nmild drowsiness, mild inattention. Severe symptoms may include altered level of\nconsciousness, seizures, cerebral edema, impairment of cognitive skills, progressive\naphasia, motor weakness.\n\nEnsure that healthcare providers administering TECELRA have immediate access to\nmedications and resuscitative equipment to manage ICANS.\n\nDuring and following TECELRA administration, closely monitor patients for signs and\nsymptoms of ICANS. Following treatment with TECELRA, monitor patients for at least 7\ndays at the healthcare facility for ICANS. Continue to monitor patients for ICANS for at\nleast 4 weeks following treatment with TECELRA. Counsel patients to seek medical\nattention should signs or symptoms of ICANS occur. At the first sign of ICANS,\nimmediately evaluate patients for hospitalization and institute treatment with supportive\ncare based on severity and consider further management per current practice\nguidelines.\n\nEffect on Ability to Drive and Use Machines\nDue to the potential for neurologic events, including dizziness and presyncope, patients\n\nreceiving TECELRA are at risk for altered or decreased coordination in the 4 weeks\nfollowing infusion.\n', 'Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or\nactivities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this initial\nperiod.\n\n5.3 Prolonged Severe Cytopenia\n\nPatients may exhibit severe cytopenias, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia\n[see Adverse Reactions (6)].\n\nPatients exhibited anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia for several weeks\nfollowing lymphodepleting chemotherapy and TECELRA infusion. Patients with Grade 2\n3 cytopenia not resolved by week 4 included anemia (9%), neutropenia (11%), and\nthrombocytopenia (5%). The median time to resolution was 7.3 weeks (range: 6.1 to 8.4\nweeks) for anemia, 9.3 weeks (range: 6.4 to 12.3 weeks) for neutropenia and 6.3 weeks\n(range: 6.1 to 6.4 weeks) for thrombocytopenia.\n\nMonitor blood counts after TECELRA infusion. Manage cytopenia with growth factor and\nblood product transfusion according to local institutional guidelines/clinical practice.\n\n5.4 Infections\n\nInfections may occur following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and TECELRA infusion.\nInfections (all grades) occurred in 32% of patients with synovial sarcoma. Grade 3 or\nhigher infections occurred in 14% of patients.\n\nDo not administer TECELRA to patients with active infections and/or inflammatory\ndisorders.\n\nMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after TECELRA\ninfusion and treat patients appropriately.\n\nFebrile neutropenia was observed in patients after TECELRA infusion and may be\nconcurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and\nmanage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids and other supportive care, as medically\nindicated.\n\nViral reactivation has occurred in patients following treatment with TECELRA. Perform\n\nscreening for Epstein-Barr Virus, Cytomegalovirus, Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus,\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus, and any other infectious agents if clinically indicated.\n\nConsider antiviral therapy to prevent viral reactivation per local guidelines.\n\n5.5 Secondary Malignancies\n\nPatients treated with TECELRA may develop secondary malignancies or recurrence of\ntheir cancer. Monitor for secondary malignancies.\n', "In the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, contact Adaptimmune at 1-855-\n24MYADAP (1-855-246-9232) to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for\ntesting.\n\n5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\nSerious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur due to dimethyl\nsulfoxide (DMSO) in TECELRA. Observe patients for hypersensitivity reactions during\ninfusion.\n\n5.7 Potential for HIV Nucleic Acid Test False-Positive Results\n\nThe lentiviral vector used to make TECELRA has limited, short spans of genetic\nmaterial which are identical to HIV. Therefore, some commercial HIV nucleic acid tests\nmay yield false-positive results in patients who have received TECELRA.\n\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\n\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction\nrates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the\nclinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n\nThe safety data described in this section reflects the exposure to TECELRA in 44\npatients with advanced synovial sarcoma treated in the SPEARHEAD-1 clinical trial\n(Cohort 1). Patients with synovial sarcoma received TECELRA across a dose of 2.68 x\n10° to 10 x 109?

Clinical studies of TECELRA did not\ninclude sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to conclude whether they\nrespond differently from younger patients.\n\n11 DESCRIPTION\n\nTECELRA (afamitresgene autoleucel) is a melanoma-associated antigen A4 (MAGE-\nA4)-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy product consisting of\nCD4 and CD8 positive T cells transduced with a self-inactivating lentiviral vector (LV)\nexpressing an affinity-enhanced T cell receptor (TCR) specific for the human MAGE-A4.\n\nAutologous T cells transduced with MAGE-A4-c1032 LV express the affinity-ennanced\nTCR on the cell surface. The TCR recognizes an HLA-A*02 restricted MAGE-A4\npeptide. MAGE-A4 is an intracellular cancer-testis antigen that has restricted expression\nin normal tissues and is expressed in synovial sarcoma.\n\nTECELRA is prepared from the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs),\nwhich are obtained via a standard leukapheresis procedure. The PBMCs are enriched\nfor T cells and are then transduced with a replication-incompetent LV containing the\nMAGE-A4 TCR transgene. The transduced T cells are expanded, washed, formulated\ninto a suspension, and cryopreserved. The product must pass a sterility test before\nrelease and shipping as a frozen suspension in one or more infusion bag(s). The\nproduct is thawed prior to infusion back into the patient [see Preparation and\nAdministration (2.2), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].\n\nThe drug product formulation contains 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\n", '12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\n\nTECELRA is a genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy consisting of CD4\nand CD8 positive T cells transduced with a self-inactivating LV to express an affinity-\nenhanced TCR specific for human MAGE-A4 on the cell surface.\n\nThe TCR recognizes an HLA-A*02 restricted MAGE-A4 peptide. MAGE-A4 is an\nintracellular cancer-testis antigen that has restricted expression in normal tissues and is\nexpressed in synovial sarcoma. Antigen-specific activation of TECELRA via TCR-\npeptide-HLA-A*02 complex results in T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and killing\nof MAGE-A4/HLA-A*02 expressing synovial sarcoma cells.\n\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics\n\nIn patients with synovial sarcoma who were treated with TECELRA, serum\nconcentrations of cytokines and other soluble factors involved in cellular homeostasis, T\ncell activation, and inflammation (e.g. IFNy, IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, and IL-2Ra) increased\npost-infusion, peaking between Days 3-8.\n\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\n\nTECELRA exhibited an initial engraftment and expansion phase followed by contraction,\nand then persistence. High inter-individual variability was observed.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of TECELRA in patients with synovial sarcoma are summarized\nIn Table 3.\n\nTable 3.

There was no evidence for preferential integration near genes of concern. No\nstudies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of TECELRA on fertility.\n\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n\nLocally Inoperable/ Metastatic Synovial Sarcoma\n\nThe efficacy of TECELRA was evaluated in a multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical\ntrial (SPEARHEAD-1, Cohort 1). The study enrolled HLA-A*02:01P, HLA-A*02:02P,\nHLA-A*02:03P, and HLA-A*02:06P allele positive patients with inoperable or metastatic\nsynovial sarcoma who had received prior systemic therapy with either doxorubicin\nand/or ifosfamide and whose tumor expressed the MAGE-A4 tumor antigen. The study\nincluded patients with measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1, Eastern\nCooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and glomerular\nfiltration rate (GFR) 2 60 mL/min. The study excluded patients with HLA-A*02:05P in\neither allele, patients on systemic corticosteroids for at least 14 days prior to\nleukapheresis and lymphodepletion, and recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem\ncell transplants.\n\nPatients underwent high resolution HLA typing at a centralized testing site and had\ntumor samples tested for MAGE-A4 expression by an immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nclinical trial assay at a centralized testing site. Patients underwent leukapheresis for\ncollection of autologous cells for processing and manufacture into TECELRA. Risk of\nmanufacturing or delivery failure was 8% in the clinical trial (4/52) patients.\n\nPatients received lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine 30 mg/m?/day for 4\ndays (Day -7 to Day -4) and cyclophosphamide 600mg/ m?/day for 3 days (Day -7 to\nDay -5). Patients with GFR 60-79 mL/min received an adjusted fludarabine dose of 20\nmg/m?/day. TECELRA was administered as a single intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1.\n\nFifty-two (52) patients were enrolled and underwent leukapheresis, eight of whom did\nnot receive TECELRA due to the following: death (n=3), loss of eligibility prior to\nlymphodepleting chemotherapy (n=3), withdrawal by patient (n=1), investigator decision\n\n13\n', "(n=1). Forty-five (45) patients with synovial sarcoma received lymphodepletion and one\npatient withdrew consent before receiving TECELRA. There were 44 patients with\nsynovial sarcoma who received a single infusion of TECELRA.\n\nAmong the efficacy analysis population demographic characteristics were as follows:\nmedian age was 41 years (range: 19 to 73 years), 50% were female, and 89% were\nWhite, and 96% were HLA-A*02:01P.\n\nThe median number of prior lines of systemic therapies was three (range: 1 to 12 lines).\nPrior therapies included ifosfamide (100%), doxorubicin (95%), pazopanib (48%),\ntrabectedin (25%), dacarbazine (11%), and gemcitabine (11%). Between leukapheresis\nand initiation of lymphodepletion, 16 (36%) of the 44 patients received bridging therapy.\nThe most commonly used bridging therapy was pazopanib (69%). The median dose of\nTECELRA was 8x10 MAGE-A4 TCR positive T cells (range: 2.68 x 10° to 9.99 x109).\n\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) according to\nRECISTv1.1 evaluated by independent review committee (IRC). Duration of response\n(DOR) was an additional outcome measure. The ORR results are presented in Table 4.\n\nTable 4.

Each TECELRA infusion bag is\nindividually packed in a metal cassette. Product and patient-specific labels are located\non both the product infusion bag(s) and the protective shipping cassette(s).\n\nEach infusion bag (250ml) is contained within a protective metal cassette (NDC 83205-\n0001-2).\n\nTECELRA is shipped in a liquid nitrogen dry vapor shipper at less than or equal to -\n130°C.\n\nStore TECELRA in the original packaging, containing the cassette(s) protecting the\ninfusion bag(s), in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen at less than or equal to -130°C.\n17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\n\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nDiscuss the following with the patient:\n\ne Inform patients that there is a chance of manufacturing or delivery failure\n(approximately 8% in the clinical trial). Therefore, a second manufacture of\nTECELRA may be attempted.\n\ne Inform patients that additional therapy (other than lymphodepletion) may be\nnecessary before TECELRA manufacturing is completed. This may increase the risk\nof adverse reactions during the pre-infusion period, which could delay or prevent\n\nadministration of TECELRA.\n\ne Inform patients that following infusion, it will be necessary to be monitored daily at\nthe healthcare facility for at least 7 days for signs and symptoms of cytokine release\n', 'syndrome (CRS). Patients must remain within proximity of a healthcare facility for at\nleast 4 weeks following infusion.\n\ne Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if any of the following occur:\n\nO\n\nCytokine Release Syndrome: inform patients that symptoms may include fever,\nrigors, fast heartbeat, irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure, lightheadedness or\ndizziness, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and headache [see\nWarnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6)].\n\nImmune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS): inform\n\npatients that symptoms may include confusion, depressed level of\nconsciousness, delirium, seizures, language difficulty [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6)].\n\nBone marrow suppression and prolonged severe cytopenias: inform patients that\nsymptoms may include bleeding or bruising, tiredness, shortness of breath, fever,\n\npain, redness for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and\nTECELRA blood counts before and after TECELRA infusion should be\nperiodically monitored [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Adverse\nReactions (6)].\n\nInfections: inform patients that they may exhibit signs or symptoms associated\nwith infection, and that past infections can be reactivated following treatment with\nTECELRA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6)].\n\nAdvise patients for the need to:\n\ne Contact Adaptimmune at 1-855-24MYADAP (1-855-246-9232) if they are diagnosed\nwith a secondary malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].\n\ne Refrain from driving or operating heavy or potentially dangerous machines for at\nleast 4 weeks after TECELRA administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 2)].\n\nManufactured by: Adaptimmune, LLC\n\n351 Rouse Boulevard\nPhiladelphia, PA 19112\n\nU.S. License Number 2315\n\n© 2024 Adaptimmune, LLC.\n', 'Medication Guide\n\nTECELRA® (pronounced tuh-sel-ruh)\n(afamitresgene autoleucel)\nRead this Medication Guide before you start your TECELRA treatment. Talk with your\nhealthcare provider if you have questions about your health condition or treatment.

It is used when other kinds of treatment do not work.\n\nTECELRA is different from other cancer medicines because it is made from your own white\nblood cells that are made to recognize and attack your cancer cells.\n\nYour healthcare provider will perform tests to see if TECELRA is right for you.\n\nBefore you get TECELRA, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical\nproblems, including:\n\nSeizure, stroke, confusion, or memory loss\n\n1\n', 'Heart, liver or kidney problems\n\nLow blood pressure\n\nLung or breathing problems\n\nRecent or active infection\n\nPast infections which can be reactivated following treatment with TECELRA\nLow blood counts\n\nPregnancy, you think you may be pregnant, or plan to become pregnant\nBreastfeeding\n\nTaking a blood thinner\n\nTell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription\nand over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.\n\nHow will | get TECELRA?\n\nSince TECELRA is made from your own white blood cells, your blood will be collected by a\nprocess called “leukapheresis” (loo-kah-fur-ee-sis). This gets sent to a company to make the\nTECELRA for you.\n\nIt takes about 6 weeks to get your TECELRA back, but the time may vary.\n\nWhile your TECELRA is being made, your healthcare provider may give you other\nmedicines to stabilize your cancer.\n\nBefore you get your TECELRA, you will get 4 days of chemotherapy to prepare your body.\n\nWhen your TECELRA is ready, you get a tube (intravenous catheter) placed into your vein\nand your dose of TECELRA will be given in one or more infusion bags. The infusion may\n\ntake up to 60 minutes for each infusion bag.\n\nAfter getting TECELRA, you will be monitored daily at the healthcare facility, for at least 7\ndays after the infusion.\n\nYou should plan to stay close to a healthcare facility for at least 4 weeks. Your healthcare\nprovider will check to see that your treatment is working and help you with any side effects\nthat may occur.\n\nYour healthcare provider will do blood tests to follow your progress.
